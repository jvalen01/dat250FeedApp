# Where is the database:
- Its located in the persistence.xml file. Im using the H2-database, an in-memory and lightweight Java database.
- data will be stored in a file named DB.mv.db in my root directory, according to the connection url. 

# How/when does the database run?
- The database is initialized and runs within the same JVM process as my application.
- All data changes are persisted to the file DB.mv.db.
- When the application shuts down, the H2 database also stops. 
- The data will be whiped out the next time i start because schema creation mode is set to 'create'.

To summarize, the H2 database runs within my application's JVM process, starting when the first database connection is made and 
stopping when my application stops. I don't need to manually start or stop the H2 database when using it in embedded mode.
